WaveFunctionCollapse implementation in C 
========================================

*This project was based on the [Maxim Gumin's wave function algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).*

The program determines a bitmap based on the input consisting of smaller tiles (.png) as well as a set of constraints (.xml). The purpose is to create an image that is [*locally similair*](#Local-Similarity) to the input images.

## Introduction

The name of the algorithm stems from the Quantum Mechanics, where it refers to a [behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) of miniscule particles which gradaully determies their position in space. Similair in a broad sense, WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) determies the orientation and coordinates of input tiles based on initial constraints. Let us consider a simplified example:

1. The bitmap consist of two spaces for tiles, which can be occupied by any of the four tiles with equal propabilities. The *entropy* of each space is 4 now. In our model, the algothim will always choose the minium *non-zero* entropy space and then choose randomly.

2. Let us say that the right space was chosen with a head occupying it. Now only straigt and tail tiles stisfy the neighbourhood rules. The choice of the head tile *propagates* itself throughout the grid.

3. Tail is chosen at random. Valid image is determined, collapse terminates.

This execution principle is extended for custom tilesets and sizes of grids. Have a look at the image generated by the tiles inspired by [Imperial College London ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), our home institution:
