WaveFunctionCollapse implementation in C 
========================================

*This project was based on the [Maxim Gumin's wave function algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).*

The program determines a bitmap based on the input consisting of smaller tiles (.png) as well as a set of constraints (.xml). The purpose is to create an image that is [*locally similair*](#Local-Similarity) to the input images.

## Introduction

The name of the algorithm stems from the Quantum Mechanics, where it refers to a [behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) of miniscule particles which gradaully determies their position in space. Similair in a broad sense, WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) determies the orientation and coordinates of input tiles based on initial constraints. Let us consider a simplified example:

1. The bitmap consist of two spaces for tiles, which can be occupied by any of the four tiles with equal propabilities. The *entropy* of each space is 4 now. In our model, the algothim will always choose the minium *non-zero* entropy space and then choose randomly.

2. Let us say that the right space was chosen with a head occupying it. Now only straigt and tail tiles stisfy the neighbourhood rules. The choice of the head tile *propagates* itself throughout the grid.

3. Tail is chosen at random. Valid image is determined, collapse terminates.

This execution principle is extended for custom tilesets and sizes of grids. Have a look at the image generated by the tiles inspired by [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), our home institution:

As you can probably spot, tiles can be rotated and flipped, the grid does not have to be a squre, any rectangular shape can be specified. 

## Local similarity

This means in principle that:

> Tiles from the tileset built up the image (ideally all tile types are present in the image at least once, subject to constraints).

## Algorithm

### Input

The input consists of several files separeted into two groups: **constraints and images**. 

#### Constraints 
Constrains is a single .xml file formatted as the following example:

```xml
<!-- dir = path_to_directory_with_png_files 
     size_x = width
     size_y = height
     -->

<tiles dir="./graphics/huxley_tiles/" size_x="10" size_y="10">
  
  <!-- each tile box follows the same pattern -->
  
  <!-- neccessary arguments
        file = name of the file 
        top/right/bottom/left = string that will be checked for equality, tiles with equal 
          values can be placed next to each other
        -->
  
  <!-- optional arguments -->
  
  <!-- flip: 
    1 - add a vertically flipped tile to the tileset
    2 - add a horizontally flipped tile
    3 - add both of the flips
    -->
  
  <!-- rotate:
    1 - 90 degrees
    2 - 180 degrees
    3 - 270 degrees
    -->
  
  <tile file="sky.png" top="sky" right="sky" bottom="sky" left="sky"/>

  <tile file="qtr_base.png" top="qtr" right="qtr_base" bottom="pavement" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_balcony.png" top="qtr" right="qtr_balcony" bottom="qtr" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_top_balcony.png" top="qtr_1" right="qtr_top_balcony" bottom="qtr" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_dome.png" top="qtr_2" right="qtr_dome" bottom="qtr_1" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_spire.png" top = "sky" right="qtr_spire" bottom ="qtr_2" left="sky" flip="2" rotate = "1"/>

  <!-- optional constrains that set grid space to a particular tile type
    file = name of the file
    x/y - coordinates of the space (origin is upper left!)
    -->
  
  <constraint file="telephone.png" x="3" y ="9"/>
  
</tiles>
```
#### Images

This is a subdirectory with png files of the same width and height (and all square). See grapics folder in the source.

### Execution

1. Read the input with optional rotations, flips and constraints.
2. Initialise a 2D array of 64 bitstrings (each bit corresponding to a tile type). True represents that a tile can occupy given space, false - the opposite. We will want all of those to have exactly one bit set. Without specified constraints, all bitstrings will be set to 11111...
3. Loop:
  i. Observation: Find elements of minimum entropy greater not equal to 1 (these spaces are already collapsed). If this is positive, go to the next step, otherwise abort (valid solution was not found).
  ii. Choose the element at random and collapse it (make its entropy 1).
4. If succesfully terminated, we have a valid image generated. 

### Output

We have implemented a live upgrated working of the algorithm. It shows the average of pixel colours of each tile possible in an element. Here is an example:

## Possible extensions

The current state of the project represents 2 weeks of team work. We are aware that there are multiple aspects which could be inproved, most notably:

* Setting the relative frequency of the tiles
* Extending the program to more dimentions (3D)
* Providing an interactive interface for users
* Adding more tilesets
